    9. Programming Project 8 in Chapter 2 asked you to write a program that 
    calculates the remaining balance on a loan after the first, second, and 
    third monthly payments. Modify the program so that it also asks the user 
    to enter the number of payments and then displays the balance remaining 
    after each of these payments.
